# v26.3.1, build 235 (2026-03-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Improved the performance by caching the OS language detection and requesting the user language only once per app start.
- Improved the chat performance by reducing unnecessary UI updates, making chats smoother and more responsive, especially in longer conversations.
- Improved the user-language logging by limiting language detection logs to a single entry per app start.
- Improved the logbook readability by removing non-readable special characters from log entries.
- Improved the logbook reliability by significantly reducing duplicate log entries.
- Fixed an issue where the app could turn white or appear invisible in certain chats after HTML-like content was shown. Thanks Inga for reporting this issue and providing some context on how to reproduce it.
