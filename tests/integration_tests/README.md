# Integration Tests

This directory contains integration-oriented test specs.

## Scope

- Behavior that depends on multiple layers working together (UI, rendering, runtime, IPC, provider responses).
- Regressions that are hard to catch with unit tests only.

## Current Feature Areas

- `chat/`: Chat rendering, input interaction, and message lifecycle.
